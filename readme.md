## Version

std=c++17

I was wondering if i kept c++11 because it is probably the most used or if i went with c++17 encouraging new projects.
I choose to go with c++17, it gives many tools and facilities that we should use

## Goals

* Having a perfectly wrapped xml lib
* Having the possibility to safely share nodes
* Being the easiest to use as possible


## Motivations

I, the author, wasn't really satisfied by what i've seen from other librairies.
Not that they're bad, but i felt like they were hard to start with.
Lots of librairies were first written in C and used so in C++.
Some have their code wrapped into classes when used in C++, but still,
in my opinion, the usage could be easier.

Also, i wanted to be sure to have LGPL license. Librairies should be shared and improved
but free for usage.

## Inspiration

librairy lxml from python3
